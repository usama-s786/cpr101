# CPR101 - FINAL GROUP PROJECT.

<br>

------------------------

# Project Overview

- Implement, test, deploy a console application to demonstrate various operation with C null-terminated strings.
- A group of 4 members will work on the project and must use MS Teams as a collaboration platform.
- This project have 3 main versions/milestones.

# Project Learning Outcomes

- Describe the interaction among hardware, system software, and application software, to prepare for the task of computer programming.
  -	See Project stages. E.g. use of git and installation & use of gcc compiler. Previous installation of software coding editor or IDE.
- Perform a range of computer interaction tasks accurately, using both graphical and command-driven interfaces, to become a skilled computer user.
- Accurately define the functions and services in modern operating systems, to improve decision-making when using and programming a computer system.
  - Generally inherent in various project tasks. Explicit in overflow protection at Version 3.
- Complete a series of tasks that use and integrate the internet, virtualization, and cloud computing, to complement the capabilities of a network-attached computer/device.
  - Microsoft Teams private channel required for project collaboration among group members.
  - Github and git.
  - (Office 365 tools used throughout the course. E.g. shared news presentation document in another part of the course, some weekly activity assignment required an examination of various collaboration methods, use of OneDrive for backup processes).
- Assemble a collection of skills, techniques, and best practices to use as an effective software developer.
  - Inherent in project requirements for documented PM and SDLC process groups, and in the project planning deliverable.
- Demonstrate how version control and project management techniques are used to improve the productivity and work quality of a computer programmer.
  - Requirement to progress through the projectâ€™s stages and the use of git version control (the world's most popular) and explicit project management planning and reporting.
